# **Innovative Idea**

- CourseCheck will be a website for UMass students to rate and review their courses, similar to how RateMyProfessor allows students to review their professors, or GreatSchools allows parents to review K-12 schools. The objective of the website is to collect and share data that will make it easier for UMass students to decide on which courses they would like to take. 

# **Important Components**

- Concrete data such as the course number, major, school year, and school semester will all be required in the review. Students may filter reviews based on this information, ex. if a student is only interested in seeing reviews from the previous or current school year.  

- Students may also score a course along metrics such as time commitment or personal interest. Statistics for the course will be calculated based on this data. Reviews may be filtered and sorted based on said statistics; for example, a student might want to only look at classes that have an average "interest" rating of above a certain value, or an average "time commitment" rating below a certain number of hours. Students may also like and dislike ratings based on their own opinion of the specific course review they see on the website, which can then be used as a filtering metric as well.


# **Home Page - Done by Manay Patel and Andy Lu**

The first image below is our application's home page, where the top navbar has the application name and logo, a search bar to search for courses or schools, and a login/signup button for any users who desire to create an account on this website. This top navbar is consistent throughout each page created for this application. Below that, we have the main search bar that only stays on the homepage and basic descriptions of what the purpose of the application is.

# **User Profile Page - Done by Muhammad Shah**

In the next image below, we have the profile page, which is for editing a user's account profile. The user can edit things like their full name, email and password and also manage their existing reviews of courses, where they can edit it or simply delete it from the website overall.

# **Course Search Page - Done by Jeffrey Wong and Andy Lu**

In the next image below, we have the course search page, which shows up upon searching for a course that exists on this page. Within this page, we have things like the course name, rating, some reviews that exist from other users, and also buttons to submit your own rating or filter the reviews by certain metrics.

# **University Search Page - Done by Manay Patel**

In the next image below, we have the school search page, which shows up upon searching for a university that exists on this page. Within this page, we have the name of the school and available courses that are offered and have existing reviews already. From there, we can also filter this list of courses at the university by the same metrics as the course search page.
