# Innovative Idea

CourseCheck will be a website for UMass students to rate and review their courses, similar to how RateMyProfessor allows students to review their professors, or GreatSchools allows parents to review K-12 schools. The objective of the website is to collect and share data that will make it easier for UMass students to decide on which courses they would like to take. 

# Important Components

Concrete data such as the course number, major, school year, and school semester will all be required in the review. Students may filter reviews based on this information, ex. if a student is only interested in seeing reviews from the previous or current school year.

Students may also score a course along metrics such as time commitment or personal interest. Statistics for the course will be calculated based on this data. Reviews may be filtered and sorted based on said statistics; for example, a student might want to only look at classes that have an average "interest" rating of above a certain value, or an average "time commitment" rating below a certain number of hours.
